# LinkedIn Automation with Selenium

## Description
This project uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into LinkedIn, navigating to a specific URL, and interacting with profile elements. It's particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks on LinkedIn like viewing profiles or gathering information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (or a compatible driver for your browser)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install selenium webdriver-manager

markdown
Copy code
3. Create `username.txt` and `password.txt` files in the project root directory. These should contain your LinkedIn username and password, respectively.

## Setup
The script `get_url.py` is the main file. It includes functions to log in to LinkedIn and perform actions on the website.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
python get_url.py

markdown
Copy code
2. The script will read your LinkedIn credentials from `username.txt` and `password.txt`, log in to LinkedIn, and perform the defined actions.

## Functions
- `login_to_linkedin(driver, username, password)`: Logs into LinkedIn using the provided credentials.
- `get_url()`: Navigates to a predefined LinkedIn URL and interacts with elements on the page.

## Disclaimer
This script is for educational purposes only. Automated interactions with LinkedIn, especially in a manner that mimics bot behavior, may violate LinkedIn's terms of service. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
